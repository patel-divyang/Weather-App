## Description

This is a simple Weather App with Javascript, using Tailwind for the phone mockup and the Weather API for the data.

This weather app takes in an input from the user. When entered in, the the city entered will show up on screen, updating the the date, and the conditions of the city. The temperatue is front and centre. Near the bottom, values are updated with current information, like precipitation, wind, and the humidity. Depending on the conditions, (clear/cloudy/rainy/snowy),  the background picture will change depending on the time (day/night). The text colour will also change based on the background picture for legibility.
